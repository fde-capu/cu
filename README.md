    The aim of C.U. is to provide
    ease  when performing  common
    tasks   as  defined  by   the
    author  (that  would be  me).
    
    This  should  do  all tricks:
    
    # sudo make all
    
    Instalation folder is:
    
    /usr/local/bin
    
    ...edit  Makefile LOCATION if
    you  wish it  was  different.

	It is all messy! Argh!

	Without sudo, use:

	# make vim
